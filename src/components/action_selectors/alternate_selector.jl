    AlternateSelector(n::Int)

Used to ensure that all actions are selected alternatively.

# Fields

- `n::Int`: means the optional actions are `1:n`.
- `step::Int=0`: record the number of times that the selector is applied.

```julia
julia> selector = AlternateSelector(n=3)

julia> any_state = 0 # for AlternateSelector, the value of actions can be anything
