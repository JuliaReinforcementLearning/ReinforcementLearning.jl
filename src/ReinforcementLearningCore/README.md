# ReinforcementLearningCore

This package is the core component of [ReinforcementLearning.jl](https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearning.jl). A general workflow is defined to describe how agents interact with environments. To understand how it is designed, please read the [blog](https://juliareinforcementlearning.org/blog/an_introduction_to_reinforcement_learning_jl_design_implementations_thoughts/#21_the_general_workflow). Besides, several common policies and utilities are also included. Please read the [doc](https://juliareinforcementlearning.org/docs/rlcore/) for more details.
