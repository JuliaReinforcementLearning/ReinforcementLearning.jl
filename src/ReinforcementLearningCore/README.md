# ReinforcementLearningCore

This package is the core component of
[ReinforcementLearning.jl](https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearning.jl).
A general workflow together with some common policies and utilities are provided
to describe how agents interact with environments. To understand how this
package is designed, please read the
[blog](https://juliareinforcementlearning.org/blog/an_introduction_to_reinforcement_learning_jl_design_implementations_thoughts/#21_the_general_workflow).
For more details please read the [doc](https://juliareinforcementlearning.org/docs/rlcore/).
