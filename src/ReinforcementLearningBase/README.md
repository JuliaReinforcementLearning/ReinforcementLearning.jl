# ReinforcementLearningBase.jl

This package provides some common constants, traits, abstractions and interfaces in developing reinforcement learning algorithms in Julia. Please read the [doc](https://juliareinforcementlearning.org/docs/rlbase/) for a full list.

Basically, we defined the following two main concepts in reinforcement learning:

- `AbstractPolicy`
- `AbstractEnv`
