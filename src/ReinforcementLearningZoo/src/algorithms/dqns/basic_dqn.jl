    BasicDQNLearner(;kwargs...)

See paper: [Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf)

This is the very basic implementation of DQN. Compared to the traditional Q
learning, the only difference is that, in the optimising step it uses a batch of
transitions sampled from an experience buffer instead of current transition. And
a neural network is used to estimate the Q-value.  You can start from this
implementation to understand how everything is organized and how to write your
own customized algorithm.

# Keyword Arguments

- `approximator`::[`Approximator`](@ref): used to get Q-values of a state.
- `loss_func=huber_loss`: the loss function to use.
- `γ::Float32=0.99f0`: discount rate.
