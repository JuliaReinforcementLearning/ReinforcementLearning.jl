# Technical Report
This technical report is the first evaluation report of Project "Enriching Offline Reinforcement Learning Algorithms in ReinforcementLearning.jl" in OSPP. It includes three components: project information, project schedule, future plan.
## Project Information
- Project name: Enriching Offline Reinforcement Learning Algorithms in ReinforcementLearning.jl
- Scheme Description: Recent advances in offline reinforcement learning make it possible to turn reinforcement learning into a data-driven discipline, such that many effective methods from the supervised learning field could be applied. Until now, the only offline method provided in ReinforcementLearning.jl is behavior cloning. We'd like to have more algorithms added like Batch Constrain Q-Learning (BCQ)\dcite{DBLP:conf/icml/FujimotoMP19}, Conservative Q-Learning (CQL)\dcite{DBLP:conf/nips/KumarZTL20}. It is expected to implement at least three to four modern offline RL algorithms.

## Project Schedule
This part mainly introduces the results of the first phase.

#### Basic framework
To run and test the offline algorithm, we first implemented `OfflinePolicy`([link](https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearning.jl/blob/master/src/ReinforcementLearningZoo/src/algorithms/offline_rl/common.jl)).
```julia
Base.@kwdef struct OfflinePolicy{L,T} <: AbstractPolicy
    learner::L
    dataset::T
    continuous::Bool
    batch_size::Int
end
```
This implementation of `OfflinePolicy` refers to `QBasePolicy` ([link](https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearning.jl/blob/master/src/ReinforcementLearningCore/src/policies/q_based_policies/q_based_policy.jl)). It provides a parameter `continuous` to support different action space types, including continuous and discrete. `learner` is a specific algorithm for learning and providing policy. `dataset` and `batch_size` are used to sample data for learning.

Besides, we implement corresponding functions `π`, `update!` and `sample`. `π` is used to select the action, whose form is determined by the type of action space. `update!` can be used in two stages. In `PreExperiment` stage, we can call this function for pre-training algorithms with `pretrain_step` parameters (such as PLAS). In `PreAct` stage, we call this function for training the `learner`. In function `update!`, we need to call function `sample` to sample a batch of data from the dataset. With the development of RLDataset.jl, the `sample` function will be deprecated.

We can quickly call the offline version of the existing algorithms with almost no additional code with this framework. Therefore, the implementation and performance testing of offline DQN and offline SAC can be completed soon. For example:

```julia
offline_dqn_policy = OfflinePolicy(
            learner = DQNLearner(
                # Omit specific code
            ),
            dataset = dataset,
            continuous = false,
            batch_size = 64,
        )
```

Therefore, we unified the parameter name in different algorithms so that different `learner` can be compatible with `OfflinePolicy`.

#### Useful Components
##### GaussianNetwork
GaussianNetwork ([link](https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearning.jl/blob/master/src/ReinforcementLearningCore/src/policies/q_based_policies/learners/approximators/neural_network_approximator.jl)) models a Normal Distribution $\mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma^2)$, which is often used in tasks with continuous action space. It consists of three neural network chains:

```julia
Base.@kwdef struct GaussianNetwork{P,U,S}
    pre::P = identity
    μ::U
    logσ::S
    min_σ::Float32 = 0f0
    max_σ::Float32 = Inf32
end
```
We have improved the evaluation function and inference function of `GaussianNetwork`. By evaluation function, given the state, then the mean and log-standard deviation are obtained. Furthermore, we can sample the action from distribution and get the probability of the action in a given state. When calling the inference function with parameter state and action, we get the likelihood of the action in a given state.

```julia
### Evaluation
function (model::GaussianNetwork)(state; is_sampling::Bool=false, is_return_log_prob::Bool=false)
    # Omit specific code
    if is_sampling
        if is_return_log_prob
            return tanh.(z), logp_π
        else
            return tanh.(z)
        end
    else
        return μ, logσ
    end
end
### Inference
function (model::GaussianNetwork)(state, action)
    # Omit specific code
    return logp_π
end
```

##### Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE)
In offline reinforcement learning tasks, VAE\dcite{DBLP:journals/corr/KingmaW13} is often used to learn from datasets to approximate behavior policy.

VAE we implemented consists of two neural network: `encoder` and `decoder` ([link](https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearning.jl/blob/master/src/ReinforcementLearningCore/src/policies/q_based_policies/learners/approximators/neural_network_approximator.jl)).
```julia
Base.@kwdef struct VAE{E, D}
    encoder::E
    decoder::D
end
```
In the encoding stage, it accepts input state and action and outputs the mean and standard deviation of the distribution. Afterward, the hidden action is obtained by sampling the distribution. In the decoding stage, state and hidden action are used as the input to reconstruct action.

During training, we call the `vae_loss` function to get the reconstruction loss and KL loss. The specific task determines the ratio of these two losses.

```julia
function vae_loss(model::VAE, state, action)
    # Omit specific code
    return recon_loss, kl_loss
end
```

In the specific algorithm, the functions that may need to be called are as follows:

```julia
### Encode + decode
function (model::VAE)(state, action)
    ### Omit specific code
    return a, μ, σ
end
### Decode
function decode(model::VAE, state, z)
    ### Omit specific code
    return a
end
```

#### Offline RL Algorithms
We used the existing algorithms and hooks to train the offline RL algorithm to create datasets in several environments (such as CartPole, Pendulum) for training. This work can guide the subsequent development of package RLDataset.jl, for example:
```julia
gen_dataset("JuliaRL-CartPole-DQN", policy, env)
```

##### Benchmark
We implemented and experimented with offline DQN (in discrete action space) and offline SAC (in continuous action space) as benchmarks. The performance of offline DQN in Cartpole environment:

\dfig{body;JuliaRL_OfflineDQN_CartPole.png}

The performance of offline SAC in Pendulum environment:

\dfig{body;JuliaRL_SAC_Pendulum.png}

##### Conservative Q-Learning (CQL)
CQL is an efficient and straightforward Q-value constraint method. Other offline RL algorithms can easily use this constraint to improve performance. Therefore, we implemented CQL as a common component ([link](https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearning.jl/blob/master/src/ReinforcementLearningCore/src/policies/q_based_policies/learners/approximators/neural_network_approximator.jl)). For other algorithms, we only need to add CQL loss to their loss.

```julia
function calculate_CQL_loss(q_value, qa_value)
    cql_loss = mean(log.(sum(exp.(q_value), dims=1)) .- qa_value)
    return cql_loss
end
### DQN loss
gs = gradient(params(Q)) do
        q = Q(s)[a]
        loss = loss_func(G, q)
        ignore() do
            learner.loss = loss
        end
        loss + calculate_CQL_loss(Q(s), q)
    end
```
After adding CQL loss, the performance of offline DQN improve.

\dfig{body;JuliaRL_OfflineDQN_CQL_CartPole.png}

Currently, this function only supports discrete action space and CQL(H) method. 

##### Critic Regularizer Regression (CRR)
CRR\dcite{DBLP:conf/nips/0001NZMSRSSGHF20} is a Behavior Cloning (BC) based method. To filter out bad actions and enables learning better policies from low-quality data, CRR utilizes the advantage function to regularize the learning objective of the actor. Pseudocode is as follows:

\dfig{body;CRR.png}

In different tasks, $f$ has different choices:
$$
𝑓=\mathbb{I}[A_\theta(s,a)>0]\quad \mathnormal{or}\quad f=e^{A_\theta(s,a)/\beta}
$$We implemented discrete CRR and continuous CRR ([link](https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearning.jl/blob/master/src/ReinforcementLearningZoo/src/algorithms/offline_rl/CRR.jl)). The brief function parameters are as follows: 

```julia
mutable struct CRRLearner{Aq, At, R} <: AbstractLearner
    ### Omit other parameters
    approximator::Aq # Actor-Critic
    target_approximator::At # Actor-Critic
    policy_improvement_mode::Symbol
    ratio_upper_bound::Float32
    beta::Float32
    advantage_estimator::Symbol
    m::Int
    continuous::Bool
end
```
Parameter `continuous` stands for the type of action space. `policy_improvement_mode` is the type of the weight function $f$. If `policy_improvement_mode=:binary`, we use the first $f$ function. Otherwise, we use the second $f$ function, which needs parameter `ratio_upper_bound` (Upper bound of $f$ value) and `beta`. Besides, we provide two methods to estimate advantage function, specifing `advantage_estimator=:mean/:max`. In the discrete case, we can calculate $A(s,a)$ directly. In the continuous case, we need to sample `m` Q-values to calculate advantage function.

Different action spaces will also affect the implementation of the Actor-Critic. In the discrete case, the Actor outputs logits of all actions in a given state. Gaussian networks are used to model the Actor in the continuous case.

Performance curve of discrete CRR algorithm in CartPole:

\dfig{body;JuliaRL_CRR_CartPole.png}

The continuous CRR algorithm still has some bugs and poor performance. 

##### Policy in the Latent Action Space (PLAS)
PLAS\dcite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2011-07213} is a policy constrain method suitable for continuous control tasks. Unlike BCQ and BEAR, PLAS implicitly constrains the policy to output actions within the support of the behavior policy through the latent action space:

\dfig{body;PLAS1.png}

PLAS pre-trains a CVAE (Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder) to constrain policy. In the pre-training phase, PLAS samples state-action pairs to train CVAE. PLAS needs to learn a deterministic policy mapping state to latent action and then uses CVAE mapping latent action to action in the training phase. When PLAS mapping state or latent action, it needs to use `tanh` function to limit the output range. 

The advantage of pre-training VAE is that it can accelerate the convergence, and it is easier to train when encountered with complex action spaces and import existing VAE models. Its pseudocode is as follows:

\dfig{body;PLAS2.png}

Please refer to this link for specific code ([link](https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearning.jl/blob/master/src/ReinforcementLearningZoo/src/algorithms/offline_rl/PLAS.jl)). The brief function parameters are as follows:
```julia
mutable struct PLASLearner{BA1, BA2, BC1, BC2, V, R} <: AbstractLearner
    ### Omit other parameters
    policy::BA1
    target_policy::BA2
    qnetwork1::BC1
    qnetwork2::BC2
    target_qnetwork1::BC1
    target_qnetwork2::BC2
    vae::V
    λ::Float32
    pretrain_step::Int
end
```
If the algorithm requires pre-training, please specify the parameter `pretrain_step` and function `update!`. We modified the run function and added an interface:
```julia
function (agent::Agent)(stage::PreExperimentStage, env::AbstractEnv)
    update!(agent.policy, agent.trajectory, env, stage)
end

function RLBase.update!(p::OfflinePolicy, traj::AbstractTrajectory, ::AbstractEnv, ::PreExperimentStage)
    l = p.learner
    if in(:pretrain_step, fieldnames(typeof(l)))
        println("Pretrain...")
        for _ in 1:l.pretrain_step
            inds, batch = sample(l.rng, p.dataset, p.batch_size)
            update!(l, batch)
        end
    end
end
```

In PLAS, we use conditional statements to select training components:
```julia
function RLBase.update!(l::PLASLearner, batch::NamedTuple{SARTS})
    if l.update_step == 0
        update_vae!(l, batch)
    else
        update_learner!(l, batch)
    end
end
```
`λ` is the parameter of clipped double Q-learning (used for Critic training), a small trick to reduce overestimation. Actor training uses the standard policy gradient method.

Performance curve of PLAS algorithm in Pendulum (`pertrain_step=1000`):
\dfig{body;JuliaRL_PLAS_Pendulum.png}

However, the action perturbation component in PLAS has not yet been completed and needs to be implemented in the second stage.

#### Other Work
In addition to the above work, we also did the following:
- Add `copyto` function in `ActorCritic`. This function is needed to synchronize between target Actor-Critic and online Actor-Critic.
- Add the tuning entropy component\dcite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1812-05905} in SAC to improve performance.

#### Conclusion
During this process, we learn a lot:
- Algorithm level. We researched more than a dozen top conference papers on offline reinforcement learning regions to implement more modern offline RL algorithms. Therefore, we understand the core problem of offline RL and how to solve the problem, as well as the shortcomings of the current method. This is of great benefit to our future research and work.
- Code level. Implementing these algorithms allowed us to increase the code and debug capabilities in Julia programming. Besides, we learned a lot of knowledge about code specifications, version management, and git usage. These experiences can be of great help to future development.
- Cooperation level. We must cooperate with everyone, including the mentor and other developers, to contribute to a public algorithm library. The ideas of the collaborators will give us a lot of inspiration.

## Future Plan
The following is our future plan:

| Date       | Work    |
| :-:       | :-:   |
| August16 - August23  | Debug and finish CRR and PLAS.  |
| August24 - August31 |  Read the paper and python code of UWAC. |
| September1 - September7 | Implement and experiment UWAC. |
| September8 - September15 | Read the paper and python code of FisherBRC. |
| September16 - September23  | Implement and experiment FisherBRC. |
| September24 - September30 | Write build-in documentation and technical report. Buffer for unexpected delay. |
| After project | Carry on fixing issues and maintain implemented algorithms.   |

Firstly, we need to fix bugs in continuous CRR and finish action perturbation component in PLAS. The current progress is slightly faster than the originally set progress, so we can implement more of the modern offline RL algorithms. The current plan includes UWAC\dcite{DBLP:conf/icml/0001ZSSZSG21} and FisherBRC\dcite{DBLP:conf/icml/KostrikovFTN21} published on ICML'21. Here we briefly introduce these two algorithms:
- Uncertainty Weighted Actor-Critic (UWAC). The algorithm is based on the improvement of BEAR\dcite{DBLP:conf/nips/KumarFSTL19}. The authors adopt a practical and effective dropout-based uncertainty estimation method, Monte Carlo (MC) dropout, to identify and ignore OOD training samples, to introduce very little overhead over existing RL algorithms.
- Fisher Behavior Regularized Critic (Fisher-BRC). The algorithm is based on the improvement of BRAC\dcite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1911-11361}. The authors propose an approach to parameterize the critic as the log-behavior-policy, which generated the offline data, plus a state-action value offset term. Behavior regularization then corresponds to an appropriate regularizer on the offset term. They propose using the Fisher divergence regularization for the offset term.

In this way, the implemented algorithms basically include the mainstream of the policy constraint method in offline reinforcement learning (including distribution matching, support constrain, implicit constraint, behavior cloning).
