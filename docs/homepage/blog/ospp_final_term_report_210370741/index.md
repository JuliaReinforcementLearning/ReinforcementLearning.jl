# Introduction

## Project Name
Establish a General Pipeline for Offline Reinforcement Learning Evaluation

## Background

In recent years, there have been several breakthroughs in the field of Reinforcement Learning with numerous practical applications where RL bots have been able to achieve superhuman performance. This is also reflected in the industry where several cutting edge solutions have been developed based on RL ([Tesla Motors](https://www.tesla.com/), [AutoML](https://cloud.google.com/automl), [DeepMind data center cooling solutions](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/deepmind-ai-reduces-google-data-centre-cooling-bill-40) just to name a few).

One of the most prominent challenges in RL is the lack of reliable environments for training RL agents. **Offline RL** has played a pivotal role in solving this problem by removing the need for the agent to interact with the environment to improve its policy over time. This brings forth the problem of not having reliable tests to verify the performance of RL algorithms. Such tests are facilitated by standard datasets ([RL Unplugged](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13888)\dcite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2006-13888}, [D4RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07219)\dcite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2004-07219} and [An Optimistic Perspective on Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04543)\dcite{agarwal2020optimistic}) that are used to train Offline RL agents and benchmark against other algorithms and implementations. [ReinforcementLearningDatasets.jl](https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearning.jl/tree/master/src/ReinforcementLearningDatasets) provides a simple solution to access various standard datasets that are available for Offline RL benchmarking across a variety of tasks.

Another problem in Offline RL is Offline Model Selection. For this, there are numerous policies that are available in [Benchmarks for Deep Off-Policy Evaluation](https://openreview.net/forum?id=kWSeGEeHvF8)\dcite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2103-16596}. ReinforcementLearningDatasets.jl will also help in loading policies that will aid in model selection in ReinforcementLearning.jl package.

## Project Overview

### Objectives

Create a package called **ReinforcementLearningDatasets.jl** that would aid in loading various standard datasets and policies that are available. Currently supported datasets are:

- [D4RL: Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/rail-berkeley/d4rl)
- [An Optimistic Perspective on Offline Reinforcement Learning (ICML, 2020)](https://github.com/google-research/batch_rl)
- [d4rl-pybullet](https://github.com/takuseno/d4rl-pybullet)
- [RL Unplugged: Benchmarks for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/deepmind/deepmind-research/tree/master/rl_unplugged)

Make standard policies in [Benchmarks for Deep Off-Policy Evaluation](https://github.com/google-research/deep_ope) to be available in RLDatasets.jl.

Implement an **Off Policy Evaluation** method and select between a number of standard policies for a particular task using RLDatasets.jl.

The following are the future work that are possible in this project.

- Parallel loading and partial loading of datasets.
- Add support for `environments` that are not supported by GymEnvs -> Flow and CARLA.
- Add support for datasets in Flow and CARLA envs.
- Add support for creating, storing and loading custom made datasets.
- `test-train` split functionality for datasets.
- Cross validation and grid search.
- Enable features that make a particular algorithm based on the requirements of the env.
- `evaluator` function that performs evaluation (can be on policy or off policy)
- Metrics as hooks. Refer [Metrics](https://d3rlpy.readthedocs.io/en/v0.90/references/metrics.html)

Refer the following [discussion](https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearning.jl/discussions/359) for more ideas.

## Datasets

### Documentation

The documentation for this package is available in [RLDatasets.jl](https://juliareinforcementlearning.org/docs/rldatasets/). Do check it out for more details.

### Installation details

To install the `ReinforcementLearningDatasets.jl` package use the following command in julia's `pkg` mode.

```
pkg> add https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearning.jl:src/ReinforcementLearningDatasets
```

### D4RL

Added support for D4RL datasets with all features loaded in the returned type.

Credits: [D4RL](https://github.com/rail-berkeley/d4rl)

```julia
using ReinforcementLearningDatasets
ds = dataset(
        "hopper-medium-replay-v0";
        repo="d4rl")
```

The type (`D4RLDataSet`) returned by `dataset` is an `Iterator` that returns batches of data based on the requirement that is specified.

Now, you could `take` the values of the `ds` or `iterate` over it.

```
julia> batches = Iterators.take(ds, 2)
D4RLDataSet{StableRNGs.LehmerRNG}(Dict{Symbol, Any}(:reward => Float32[0.9236555, 0.8713692, 0.92237693, 0.9839225, 0.91540813, 0.8331875, 0.8102179, 0.78385466, 0.7304337, 0.6942671  …  5.0350657, 5.005931, 4.998442, 4.986662, 4.9730926, 4.9638906, 4.9503803, 4.9326644, 4.8952913, 4.8448896], :state => Float32[1.2521756 1.2519351 … 0.72994494 0.7145643; 0.00026937472 -0.0048946342 … 0.13946348 0.15210924; … ; 0.002733759 -1.1853988 … -0.06101464 -0.045892276; -0.0028058232 0.08466121 … -1.4235892 -1.0558393], :action => Float32[-0.67060924 -0.39061046 … -0.15234122 -0.1382414; -0.9329903 0.65977097 … 0.9518685 0.9666188; 0.010210991 -0.073685646 … 0.24721281 -0.2440847], :terminal => Int8[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0  …  0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]), "d4rl", 200919, 256, (:state, :action, :reward, :terminal, :next_state), StableRNGs.LehmerRNG(state=0x000000000000000000000000000000f7), Dict{String, Any}("timeouts" => Int8[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0  …  0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]), true)

julia> typeof(batches)
Base.Iterators.Take{D4RLDataSet{StableRNGs.LehmerRNG}}

julia> batch = collect(batches)[1]
NamedTuple{(:state, :action, :reward, :terminal, :next_state), Tuple{Matrix{Float32}, Matrix{Float32}, Vector{Float32}, Vector{Int8}, Matrix{Float32}}}

julia> size(batch[:state])
(11, 256)
```

### d4rl-pybullet

Added support for datasets released in `d4rl-pybullet`. This enables testing the agents in complex environments without `Mujoco` license.

Credits: [d4rl-pybullet](https://github.com/takuseno/d4rl-pybullet)

```julia
using ReinforcementLearningDatasets
ds = dataset(
        "hopper-bullet-mixed-v0";
        repo="d4rl-pybullet",
    )
samples = Iterators.take(ds, 2)

```
The output is similar to D4RL.

### Google Research Atari DQN Replay Datasets

Added support for `Google Research Atari DQN Replay Datasets`. Currently, the datasets are directly loaded into the RAM and therefore, it is advised to be used only with sufficient amount of RAM (around 20 GB of free space). Support for lazy parallel loading in a `Channel` will be given soon. 

Credits: [DQN Replay Datasets](https://github.com/google-research/batch_rl)

```julia
using ReinforcementLearningDatasets
ds = dataset(
        "pong",
        1,
        [1, 2]
    )
samples = Iterators.take(ds, 2)
```

The output is similar to D4RL.

### RL Unplugged Atari Dataset

Added support for `RL Unplugged` atari datasets. The datasets that are stored in the form of `.tfrecord` are fetched into julia. Lazy loading with multi threading is implemented. This implementation is based on previous work in [TFRecord.jl](https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/TFRecord.jl).

Credits: [RL Unplugged](https://github.com/deepmind/deepmind-research/tree/master/rl_unplugged)

```julia
using ReinforcementLearningDatasets
ds = ds = rl_unplugged_atari_dataset(
        "Pong",
        1,
        [1, 2]
    )
```

The type that is returned is a `Channel{AtariRLTransition}` which returns batches with the given specifications from the buffer when `take!` is used. The point to be noted here is that it takes seconds to load the datasets into the `Channel` and the loading is highly customizable.

```julia
julia> ds = ds = rl_unplugged_atari_dataset(
               "Pong",
               1,
               [1, 2]
           )
[ Info: Loading the shards [1, 2] in 1 run of Pong with 4 threads
Progress: 100%|██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████| Time: 0:00:08
Channel{ReinforcementLearningDatasets.AtariRLTransition}(12) (12 items available)
```

It also supports lazy downloading of the datasets based on the `shards` that are required by the user. In this case only `gs://rl_unplugged/atari/Pong/atari_Pong_run_1-00001-of-00100` and `gs://rl_unplugged/atari/Pong/atari_Pong_run_1-00002-of-00100` will only be downloaded with permissions from the user. If it is already present the `dataset` is located using `DataDeps.jl`. 

The loading time for batches is also very minimal.

```
julia> @time batch = take!(ds)
0.000011 seconds (1 allocation: 80 bytes)

julia> typeof(batch)
ReinforcementLearningDatasets.AtariRLTransition

julia> typeof(batch.state)
Array{UInt8, 4}

julia> size(batch.state)
(84, 84, 4, 256)

julia> size(batch.reward)
(256,)
```

## Implementation Details and Challenges Faced

The challenge that was faced during the first week was to chart out a direction for RLDatasets.jl. I researched the implementations of the pipeline in [d3rlpy](https://github.com/takuseno/d3rlpy), [TF.data.Dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets) etc and then narrowed down some inspiring ideas in the [discussion](https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearning.jl/discussions/359).

Later, I made the [implementation](https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearning.jl/pull/384) as a wrapper around d4rl python library, which was discarded as it did not align with the purpose of the library of being lightweight and not requiring a `Mujoco license` for usage of open source datasets. A wrapper would also not give the fine grained control that we could get if we load the datasets natively.

We decided to use [DataDeps.jl](https://github.com/oxinabox/DataDeps.jl) for registering, tracking and locating datasets without any hassle. [DataDeps.jl](https://github.com/JuliaComputing/DataSets.jl) is a package that helps make data wrangling code more reusable and was crucial in making RLDatasets.jl seamless.

What I learnt here was how to make a package, manage its dependencies and choose which package would be the right fit for the job. I also learnt about `Iterator` interfaces in julia to convert the type (that is output by the `dataset` function) into an `Iterator`. `d4rl-pybullet` was also implemented in a similar fashion.

Implementation of `Google Research Atari DQN Replay Datasets` was harder because it was quite a large dataset and even one shard didn't fit into memory of my machine. I also had to figure out how the data was stored and how to retrieve it. Initially, I planned to use `GZip.jl` to unpack the gzip files and use `NPZ.jl` to read the files. Since, NPZ didn't support reading from `GZipStream` by itself, I had to adapt the functions in `NPZ` to read the stream. Later, we decided to use `CodecZlib` to get a decompressed buffer channel output which was natively supported by `NPZ`. We also had to test it internally and skip the CI test because CI wouldn't be able to handle the dataset. Exploring the possibility of lazy loading of the files that are available and enabling it is also within the scope of the project.

For supporting `RL Unplugged dataset` I had to learn about `.tfrecord` files, `Protocol Buffers`, `buffered Channels` and julia `multi threading` which was used in a lot of occasions. It took some time to grasp all the concepts but the final implementation, however, was based on already existing work in `TFRecord.jl`.

All of this work wouldn't have been possible without the patient mentoring and vast knowledge of my mentor [Jun Tian](https://github.com/findmyway), who has been pivotal in the design and implementation of the package. His massive experience and beautifully written code has provided a lot of inspiration to the making of this package. His amicable nature and commitment to the users of the package by providing timely and detailed explanations to any issues or queries related to the package despite his time constraints, has provided a long standing example as a developer and as a person. I also thank all the developers of the packages that `RLDatasets.jl` depends upon.

### Implementation details

#### Directory Structure

The `src` directory hosts the working logic of the package.

```
src
├─ ReinforcementLearningDatasets.jl
├─ atari
│  ├─ atari_dataset.jl
│  └─ register.jl
├─ common.jl
├─ d4rl
│  ├─ d4rl
│  │  └─ register.jl
│  ├─ d4rl_dataset.jl
│  └─ d4rl_pybullet
│     └─ register.jl
├─ init.jl
└─ rl_unplugged
   ├─ atari
   │  ├─ register.jl
   │  └─ rl_unplugged_atari.jl
   └─ util.jl
```

The directory for handling each dataset would consist of two files. The `register.jl` that would register the `DataDeps` that are required and another file that is responsible for loading the datasets. The `init` functions are called in the project `__init__` for registering right after it is imported.

```julia
function __init__()
    RLDatasets.d4rl_init()
    RLDatasets.d4rl_pybullet_init()
    RLDatasets.atari_init()
    RLDatasets.rl_unplugged_atari_init()
end
```

#### D4RL Datasets implementation

The `register.jl` for d4rl dataset is located in `src/d4rl/d4rl` which registers the `DataDeps`. The following is an example code for the registration.

```julia
function d4rl_init()
    repo = "d4rl"
    for ds in keys(D4RL_DATASET_URLS)
        register(
            DataDep(
                repo*"-"* ds,
                """
                Credits: https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07219
                The following dataset is fetched from the d4rl. 
                The dataset is fetched and modified in a form that is useful for RL.jl package.
                
                Dataset information: 
                Name: $(ds)
                $(if ds in keys(D4RL_REF_MAX_SCORE) "MAXIMUM_SCORE: " * string(D4RL_REF_MAX_SCORE[ds]) end)
                $(if ds in keys(D4RL_REF_MIN_SCORE) "MINIMUM_SCORE: " * string(D4RL_REF_MIN_SCORE[ds]) end) 
                """, #check if the MAX and MIN score part is even necessary and make the log file prettier
                D4RL_DATASET_URLS[ds],
            )
        )
    end
    nothing
end
```

The dataset is loaded using `ReinforcementLearningDatasets/src/d4rl/d4rl_dataset.jl` and is enclosed in a `D4RLDataSet` type.

```julia
struct D4RLDataSet{T<:AbstractRNG} <: RLDataSet
    dataset::Dict{Symbol, Any}
    repo::String
    dataset_size::Integer
    batch_size::Integer
    style::Tuple
    rng::T
    meta::Dict
    is_shuffle::Bool
end
```

The dataset function is used to retrieve the files.

```julia
function dataset(dataset::String;
    style=SARTS,
    repo = "d4rl",
    rng = StableRNG(123), 
    is_shuffle = true, 
    batch_size=256
)
```

The dataset is downloaded if the dataset is not present and loaded from the local file system using `DataDeps.jl` 

```julia
try 
    @datadep_str repo*"-"*dataset 
catch 
    throw("The provided dataset is not available") 
end
    
path = @datadep_str repo*"-"*dataset 

@assert length(readdir(path)) == 1
file_name = readdir(path)[1]

data = h5open(path*"/"*file_name, "r") do file
    read(file)
end
```

The dataset is loaded into `D4RLDataSet` `Iterator` and returned. The iteration logic is also implemented in the same file using `Iterator` interfaces.

#### RL Unplugged Atari

Some of the interesting pieces of code used in loading RL Unplugged dataset.

Multi threaded iteration over a `Channel{Example}` to `put!` into another `Channel{AtariRLTransition}`.

```julia
ch_src = Channel{AtariRLTransition}(n * tf_reader_sz) do ch
    for fs in partition(shuffled_files, n)
        Threads.foreach(
            TFRecord.read(
                fs;
                compression=:gzip,
                bufsize=tf_reader_bufsize,
                channel_size=tf_reader_sz,
            );
            schedule=Threads.StaticSchedule()
        ) do x
            put!(ch, AtariRLTransition(x))
        end
    end
end
```

Multi threaded batching using a parallel loop where each thread loads the batches into `Channel{AtariRLTransition}`.

```julia
res = Channel{AtariRLTransition}(n_preallocations; taskref=taskref, spawn=true) do ch
    Threads.@threads for i in 1:batch_size
        put!(ch, deepcopy(batch(buffer_template, popfirst!(transitions), i)))
    end
end
```

### Bsuite Datasets
It involved work similar to RL Unplugged Atari Datasets which involves multi threaded dataloading. It is implemented using a [`Ring Buffer`](https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearning.jl/blob/f1837a93c4c061925d92167c3480a423007dae5c/src/ReinforcementLearningDatasets/src/rl_unplugged/util.jl#L89) for storing and loading batches of data.

#### Ring Buffer

Huge thanks to [Jun Tian](https://github.com/findmyway) for the implementation.

The RingBuffer is based on having two `Channel`s, one for holding the buffer that contains empty batches (`buffers`) that can be used later for making batches with data. The `results` `Channel` is used for holding batches with data. The `current` holds the latest result.

```julia
mutable struct RingBuffer{T} <: AbstractChannel{T}
    buffers::Channel{T}
    current::T
    results::Channel{T}
end
```
The `RingBuffer` is created using the following code. It creates an empty `buffers` `Channel` that is then used to fill up `results` by performing inplace operations for making batches with data.

```julia
function RingBuffer(f!, buffer::T;sz=Threads.nthreads(), taskref=nothing) where T
    buffers = Channel{T}(sz)
    for _ in 1:sz
        put!(buffers, deepcopy(buffer))
    end
    results = Channel{T}(sz, spawn=true, taskref=taskref) do ch
        Threads.foreach(buffers;schedule=Threads.StaticSchedule()) do x
        # for x in buffers
            f!(x)  # in-place operation
            put!(ch, x)
        end
    end
    RingBuffer(buffers, buffer, results)
end
```

Whenever a batch is taken from the buffer, the following code gets called.

```julia
function Base.take!(b::RingBuffer)
    put!(b.buffers, b.current)
    b.current = take!(b.results)
    b.current
end
```

I would have implemented a simpler one channel buffer, but `RingBuffer` proved to be more effective.

#### Implementation
The files are read and the datapoints are put in a `Channel`.
```julia
ch_src = Channel{BSuiteRLTransition}(n * tf_reader_sz) do ch
    for fs in partition(files, n)
        Threads.foreach(
            TFRecord.read(
                fs;
                compression=:gzip,
                bufsize=tf_reader_bufsize,
                channel_size=tf_reader_sz,
            );
            schedule=Threads.StaticSchedule()
        ) do x
            put!(ch, BSuiteRLTransition(x, game))
        end
    end
end
```
The datapoints are then put in a `RingBuffer` which is returned.
```julia
res = RingBuffer(buffer;taskref=taskref, sz=n_preallocations) do buff
    Threads.@threads for i in 1:batch_size
        batch!(buff, take!(transitions), i)
    end
end
```
#### Working
The `bsuite_params` function can be used to get the possible arguments that can be passed into the function.
```julia
julia> bsuite_params()
┌ Info: ["cartpole", "catch", "mountain_car"]
│   shards = 0:4
└   type = 3-element Vector{String}: …
```

To get the dataset `rl_unplugged_bsuite_dataset` function can be called.
```julia
julia> rl_unplugged_bsuite_dataset("cartpole", [1], "full")

### DM Datasets

The DM datasets load and work similarly to bsuite datasets. Since, I made one file to manage `DM Control`, `DM Lab` and `DM Locomotion`, there had to be a lot of post processing work to handle all the edge cases presented by each of the dataset.

The types also had to be created based on the individual datasets so that the code is good at loading efficiently.

#### Example of type handling used.
```julia
function make_transition(example::TFRecord.Example, feature_size::Dict{String, Tuple})
    f = example.features.feature
    
    observation_dict = Dict{Symbol, AbstractArray}()
    next_observation_dict = Dict{Symbol, AbstractArray}()
    transition_dict = Dict{Symbol, Any}()

    for feature in keys(feature_size)
        if split(feature, "/")[1] == "observation"
            ob_key = Symbol(chop(feature, head = length("observation")+1, tail=0))
            if split(feature, "/")[end] == "egocentric_camera"
                cam_feature_size = feature_size[feature]
                ob_size = prod(cam_feature_size)
                observation_dict[ob_key] = reshape(f[feature].bytes_list.value[1][1:ob_size], cam_feature_size...)
                next_observation_dict[ob_key] = reshape(f[feature].bytes_list.value[1][ob_size+1:end], cam_feature_size...)
            else
                if feature_size[feature] == ()
                    observation_dict[ob_key] = f[feature].float_list.value
                else
                    ob_size = feature_size[feature][1]
                    observation_dict[ob_key] = f[feature].float_list.value[1:ob_size]
                    next_observation_dict[ob_key] = f[feature].float_list.value[ob_size+1:end]
                end
            end
        elseif feature == "action"
            ob_size = feature_size[feature][1]
            action = f[feature].float_list.value
            transition_dict[:action] = action[1:ob_size]
            transition_dict[:next_action] = action[ob_size+1:end]
        elseif feature == "step_type"
            transition_dict[:terminal] = f[feature].float_list.value[1] == 2
        else
            ob_key = Symbol(feature)
            transition_dict[ob_key] = f[feature].float_list.value[1]
        end
    end
    state_nt = (state = NamedTuple(observation_dict),)
    next_state_nt = (next_state = NamedTuple(next_observation_dict),)
    transition = NamedTuple(transition_dict)

    merge(transition, state_nt, next_state_nt)
end
```
The batch is made based on the internal types that are available based on the specific dataset.

### Deep OPE

Support is given for D4RL policies provided in [Deep OPE](https://github.com/google-research/deep_ope)\dcite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2103-16596}.

#### Implementation
The policies that are given [here](https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearning.jl/blob/master/src/ReinforcementLearningDatasets/src/deep_ope/d4rl/d4rl_policies.jl) are loaded using `d4rl_policy` function.

The policies are loaded into a `D4RLGaussianNetwork` which will be integrated into `GaussianNetwork` in RLCore soon.
```julia
Base.@kwdef struct D4RLGaussianNetwork{P,U,S}
    pre::P = identity
    μ::U
    logσ::S
end
```

The network returns the `a`, `μ` based on the parameters that are passed into it.

```julia
function (model::D4RLGaussianNetwork)(
    state::AbstractArray;
    rng::AbstractRNG=MersenneTwister(123), 
    noisy::Bool=true
)
    x = model.pre(state)
    μ, logσ = model.μ(x), model.logσ(x)
    if noisy
        a = μ + exp.(logσ) .* Float32.(randn(rng, size(μ)))
    else
        a = μ + exp.(logσ)
    end
    a, μ
end 
```
The weights are loaded using the following [code](https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearning.jl/blob/master/src/ReinforcementLearningDatasets/src/deep_ope/d4rl/d4rl_policy.jl).

To know the real life performance of the networks an auxillary function `deep_ope_d4rl_evaluate` is also given which gives the unicode plot showing the performance of the policy. The code is given [here](https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearning.jl/blob/master/src/ReinforcementLearningDatasets/src/deep_ope/d4rl/evaluate.jl).

#### Working
The params needed for loading the policies can be obtained using `d4rl_policy_params`

```julia
julia> d4rl_policy_params()
┌ Info: Set(["relocate", "maze2d_large", "antmaze_umaze", "hopper", "pen", "antmaze_medium", "walker", "hammer", "antmaze_large", "maze2d_umaze", "maze2d_medium", "ant", "door", "halfcheetah"])
│   agent = 2-element Vector{String}: …
└   epoch = 0:10
```

Sometimes the expected policy may not be available. So, it is always better to check which ones are available using `ReinforcementLearningDatasets.D4RL_POLICIES`.

```julia
julia> policy = d4rl_policy("hopper", "online", 3)
D4RLGaussianNetwork{Flux.Chain{Tuple{Flux.Dense{typeof(NNlib.relu), Matrix{Float32}, Vector{Float32}}, Flux.Dense{typeof(NNlib.relu), Matrix{Float32}, Vector{Float32}}}}, Flux.Chain{Tuple{Flux.Dense{typeof(identity), Matrix{Float32}, Vector{Float32}}}}, Flux.Chain{Tuple{Flux.Dense{typeof(identity), Matrix{Float32}, Vector{Float32}}}}}(Chain(Dense(11, 256, relu), Dense(256, 256, relu)), Chain(Dense(256, 3)), Chain(Dense(256, 3)))
```

The policy will return the `a` and `μ` for a state that is given.

`deep_ope_d4rl_evaluate` is a helper function that helps visualize the performance of the agent. The more the epoch number, the better the performance.

### FQE
A major amount of time was spent on researching about OPE methods of which `FQE` was the most appropriate given that the use case is Deep Reinforcement Learning.

[Batch Policy Learning under Constraints](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.08738.pdf)\dcite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1903-08738} introduces the FQE and uses it for offline reinforcement learning under constraints and achieves remarkable results by calculating new constraint cost functions with the datasets. The algorithm that is implemented in RLZoo is similar to the one that is proposed here.

\dfig{body;FQE_Original.png}

The implementation in RLZoo is based on [Hyperparameter Selection for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.09055.pdf)\dcite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2007-09055}. This is very similar to the algorithm that we discussed earlier. The paper uses OPE as a method for offline hyper paramater selection.

\dfig{body;OPE_and_Online_Hyperparameter_Selection.png}

The average of values caldulated by FQE based on initial states can be taken as the reward that the policy would gain from the environment. So, the same can be used for online hyper parameter selection.

The pseudocode for the implementation and the objective function are as follows.

\dfig{body;FQE_Impl.png}

\dfig{body;FQE_Objective.png}

#### Implementation
Function parameters for the implementation.

```julia
mutable struct FQE{
    P<:GaussianNetwork,
    C<:NeuralNetworkApproximator,
    C_T<:NeuralNetworkApproximator,
    R<:AbstractRNG,
 } <: AbstractLearner
    policy::P
    q_network::C
    target_q_network::C_T
    n_evals::Int
    γ::Float32
    batch_size::Int
    update_freq::Int
    update_step::Int
    tar_update_freq::Int
    rng::R
    #logging
    loss::Float32
end
```

The update function for the learner is a simple critic update based on the following procedure.

```julia
function RLBase.update!(l::FQE, batch::NamedTuple{SARTS})
    policy = l.policy
    Q, Qₜ = l.q_network, l.target_q_network

    D = device(Q)
    s, a, r, t, s′ = (send_to_device(D, batch[x]) for x in SARTS)
    γ = l.γ
    batch_size = l.batch_size

    loss_func = Flux.Losses.mse

    q′ = Qₜ(vcat(s′, policy(s′)[1])) |> vec

    target = r .+ γ .* (1 .- t) .* q′

    gs = gradient(params(Q)) do
        q = Q(vcat(s, reshape(a, :, batch_size))) |> vec
        loss = loss_func(q, target)
        Zygote.ignore() do
            l.loss = loss
        end
        loss
    end
    Flux.Optimise.update!(Q.optimizer, params(Q), gs)

    if l.update_step % l.tar_update_freq == 0
        Qₜ = deepcopy(Q)
    end
end
```
#### Results
The [implementation](https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearning.jl/pull/515) is still a work in progress because of some sampling error. But the algorithm that I implemented without RL.jl framework works as expected. 

##### Parameter Values
-  Policy => CRR Policy
-  Env => PendulumEnv
-  q_networks => Two 64 neuron layers with `n_s+n_a` input neurons and `1` output neuron.
-  optimizer => ADAM(0.005)
-  loss => Flux.Losses.mse
-  γ => 0.99
-  batch_size => 256
-  update_freq, update_step => 1
-  tar_update_freq => 256

### Conclusion
The foundations of RLDatasets.jl package has been laid during the course of the project. The basic datasets except for Real World Datasets from RL Unplugged have been supported. Furthermore, D4RL policies have been successfully loaded and tested. The algorithm for FQE has been tried out with a minor implementation detail pending. 

With the completion of FQE the four requirements of OPE as laid out by [Deep OPE](https://github.com/google-research/deep_ope)\dcite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2103-16596} will be completed for D4RL.

\dfig{body;OPE_Requirements.png}

#### Implications

Equipping RL.jl with RLDatasets.jl is a key step in making the package more industry relevant because different offline algorithms can be compared with respect to a variety of standard offline dataset benchmarks. It is also meant to improve the implementations of existing offline algorithms and make it on par with the SOTA implementations. This package provides a seamless way of downloading and accessing existing datasets and also supports loading datasets into memory with ease, which if implemented separately, would be tedious for the user. It also incorporates policies that can be useful for testing Off Policy Evaluation Methods.

#### Future Scope
There are several exciting work that are possible from this point.

- Testing and improvement of already existing Offline Algorithms in RLZoo.jl.
- Integrating the existing RLDatasets.jl package to work well with RL.jl.
- Implementing more OPE algorithms proposed in [Empirical Study of Off-Policy Policy Evaluation for Reinforcement Learning paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.06854.pdf)\dcite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1911-06854} for use in Deep RL and Tabular RL.
- Implementation of other FQE methods like DiscreteFQE, [FQE-L2 (Statistical Bootstrapping for Uncertainty Estimation in Off-Policy Evaluation)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.13609.pdf)\dcite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2007-13609}.
- Adding standard difficult benchmarks for existing Offline RL methods.
- Adding environments to work out of the box for evaluation of OPE methods.
- Adding Scikit learn like [features](https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearning.jl/discussions/359) on top of RLDataset.jl.
