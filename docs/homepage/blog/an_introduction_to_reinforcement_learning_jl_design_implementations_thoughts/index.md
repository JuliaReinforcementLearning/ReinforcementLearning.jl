## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Scope of ReinforcementLearning.jl

The goal of ReinforcementLearning.jl is to provide a collection of tools for learning and implementing reinforcement learning algorithms. This means that, unlike many other existing packages focusing on **deep reinforcement learning** only, we aim to build a rich ecosystem to solve different kinds of tasks in reinforcement learning, including but not limited to the following fields:

- Tabular reinforcement learning
- Deep reinforcement learning
- Offline reinforcement learning
- Multi-agent reinforcement learning
- Model-based reinforcement learning

### 1.2 Why Julia?

Although most existing reinforcement learning related packages are written in Python with PyTorch or Tensorflow as the backend, we choose Julia because of the following advantages:

- [Multiple dispatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_dispatch) in Julia makes the code very easy to read, understand and extend. Without this feature, it's hard to imagine how to organize such a package targeting so many different tasks in an elegant way.
- [Composable Multi-threading](https://julialang.org/blog/2019/07/multithreading/) boost the speed of interactions between agents and environments.
- Julia is [fast](https://www.julialang.org/benchmarks/) and easy to [interact with other programming languages](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/calling-c-and-fortran-code/) like Python, C, C++, fortran so that we can easily leverage many existing packages.

### 1.3 Related Work

Many existing packages inspired the development of ReinforcementLearning.jl a lot. Following are some important ones.

- [Dopamine](https://google.github.io/dopamine/)\dcite{dayan2009dopamine} provides a clear implementation of the **Rainbow**\dcite{hessel2018rainbow} algorithm. The [gin](https://github.com/google/gin-config) config file template and the concise workflow is the origin of the `Experiment` in ReinforcementLearning.jl.
- [OpenSpiel](https://github.com/deepmind/open_spiel)\dcite{LanctotEtAl2019OpenSpiel} provides a lot of useful functions to describe many different kinds of games. They are turned into traits in our package.
- [Ray/rllib](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/rllib.html)\dcite{liang2017ray} has many nice abstraction layers in the policy part. We also borrowed the definition of environments here. This is explained with details in section 2.
- [rlpyt](https://github.com/astooke/rlpyt)\dcite{stooke2019rlpyt} has a nice code structure and we borrowed some implementations of policy gradient algorithms from it.
- [Acme](https://github.com/deepmind/acme)\dcite{hoffman2020acme} offers a framework for distributed reinforcement learning.

## 2. Design

### 2.1 The General Workflow

The standard setting for reinforcement learning contains two parts: **Agent** and **Environment**. To make things general enough, we defined two abstract types: `AbstractPolicy` and `AbstractEnv` correspondingly.

\dfig{body;2021-02-20_17_41_54-draft.pptx_-_PowerPoint.png; A general workflow between policy and environment.}

Figure 1: The general flow between a policy and an environment.

A policy simply takes a look at the environment and yields an action. And an environment will modify its internal state once received an action. So for *continuing tasks*, we can describe the workflow with the following code:

```julia
function Base.run(policy, env)
    while true
        env |> policy |> env
    end
end
```

For *episodic tasks*, two extra methods must be implemented for the `env`:

- `is_terminated(env::AbstractEnv)` detects if the environment is already terminated or not.
- `reset!(env::AbstractEnv)` resets the `env` to an initial state.

Then we have the following code:

```julia
function Base.run(policy, env)
    while true
        reset!(env)
        while !is_terminated(env)
            env |> policy |> env
        end
    end
end
```

In real world tasks, we never expect the workflow to run infinitely. Usually we will stop early after a number of steps/episodes or when the policy or environment meet some specific condition. Now let's introduce a `stop_condition` which examines `policy` and `env` after each step to control the workflow.

```julia
function Base.run(policy, env, stop_condition)
    while true
        reset!(env)
        while !is_terminated(env)
            env |> policy |> env
            stop_condition(policy, env) && return
        end
    end
end
```

Until now, a policy is still very general. We don't know it's actually updating or exploiting.  However, in most cases, if a policy needs to be updated during interactions with the environment, it needs a buffer to collect some necessary information and then use it to update its strategy at some time. So a special policy named `Agent`   is provided in our package to help update a policy.

\dfig{body;Untitled.png;An illustration of Agent.}

An agent is simply a combination of any policy to be updated and a corresponding experience replay buffer (we call it `AbstractTrajectory` ). And we split the above workflow into the following stages to allow injecting different updating logics:

- `PreExperimentStage`
- `PreEpisodeStage`
- `PreActStage`
- `PostActStage`
- `PostEpisodeStage`
- `PostExperimentStage`

```julia
function Base.run(policy, env, stop_condition)
    while true
        reset!(env)
        policy(PRE_EPISODE_STAGE, env)
        while !is_terminated(env)
            action = policy(env)
            policy(PRE_ACT_STAGE, env, action)
            env(action)
            policy(POST_ACT_STAGE, env)
            stop_condition(policy, env) && return
        end
        policy(POST_EPISODE_STAGE, env)
    end
end
```

Note that by default, `(policy::AbstractPolicy)(::AbstractStage, env)` will do nothing and the workflow is simplified to the earlier version. For the specific policy `Agent`, it will update its internal `policy` and `trajectory` at each stage:

- `update!(policy, trajectory, env, stage)` (Read as `update!` the inner `policy` given a `trajectory`, `env` and the current `stage`)
- `update!(trajectory, policy, env, stage)` (Read as `update!` the inner `trajectory` given a `policy`, `env` and the current `stage`)
- `update!(trajectory, policy, env, ::PreActStage, action)` (The `action` here is the one selected by the policy to be executed on the `env`)

By default, `update!(policy, trajectory, env, stage)` will do nothing. The default implementation of `update!(trajectory, policy, env, stage)` is explained in the **2.2 Trajectory** section. But developers can customize these behaviors easily thanks to multiple dispatch.

Now the policy can play happily with the environment. We would also want to inject some meaningful actions in the meantime. For example, collecting the total reward of each episode, logging the loss of each updating, saving the policy periodically, modifying some hyperparameters on the fly and so on. So a general callback is introduced. 

```julia
function Base.run(policy, env, stop_condition, hook)
    hook(PRE_EXPERIMENT_STAGE, env)
    while true
        reset!(env)
        policy(PRE_EPISODE_STAGE, env)
        hook(PRE_EPISODE_STAGE, env)
        while !is_terminated(env)
            action = policy(env)
            policy(PRE_ACT_STAGE, env, action)
            hook(PRE_ACT_STAGE, env, action)
            env(action)
            policy(POST_ACT_STAGE, env)
            hook(POST_ACT_STAGE, env)
            stop_condition(policy, env) && return
        end
        policy(POST_EPISODE_STAGE, env)
        hook(POST_EPISODE_STAGE, env)
    end
end
```

Except for some corner cases, the code above is very close to [our implementation](https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearningCore.jl/blob/master/src/core/run.jl).

### 2.2 Trajectory

We use the `AbstractTrajectory` to describe the container used to collect intermediate data during the interactions between policy and environment. Among all the different implementations, the simplest one is `Trajectory`. Essentially, it's just a wrapper of a `NamedTuple` with some customized behaviors to avoid *type piracy*.

\dfig{page;Presentation1.gif; The default implementation of `VectorSARTTrajectory`.}

The above figure illustrates the simplest trajectory: `VectorSARTTrajectory`. It contains four traces: `state`, `action`, `reward` and `terminal`. Each trace simply use a `Vector` as the container. By default, the trajectory is assumed to be of the **SARTSA** format (**S**tate, **A**ction, **R**eward, **T**ermination, next-**S**tate, next-**A**ction). For different policies, developers may replace the inner container, add/remove traces or customize the inserting/removing/sampling strategy. All the available built-in trajectories can be found [here](https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearningCore.jl/tree/master/src/policies/agents/trajectories).

### 2.3 Approximator

For environments with a small state space, we can use a table to record the state value, state-action value (or any other values we are interested in). While in environments with a large state space, we often use a neural network to estimate the values nowadays. To generalize these two cases, an `AbstractApproximator` is introduced. Basically it's just parameters (either tabular or neural network based) plus an optimizer. Another benefit of introducing such a layer is to hide the underlying DNN framework from developers so that we can easily switch from [Flux.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl) to [Knet.jl](https://github.com/denizyuret/Knet.jl) or something else.

## 3. Algorithm Implementations

In this section, we'll give a brief introduction to different types of reinforcement learning algorithms implemented in our package. After that we'll relate these algorithms with the underlying components provided in our package. Developers should feel confident to implement new algorithms after reading this section. Note that all the code snippets here are for illustration only, they may differ from the one provided in the package.

Following the standard textbook definitions\dcite{sutton2018reinforcement}, the interactions between an agent and environment can be formalized as a fully-observable or partially-observable Markov decision process ((PO)MDP). Here we focus on the fully-observable MDP. The MDP is defined as a tuple $\mathcal{M} = (\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{T}, d_0, r, \gamma)$ where

- $\mathcal{S}$ is a set of states $s \in \mathcal{S}$
- $\mathcal{A}$ is a set of actions
- $\mathcal{T}$ is a conditional probability distribution $\mathcal{T}(s_{t+1}|s_t, a_t)$
- $d_0$ is the initial state distribution of $s_0$
- $r$ is a reward function: $\mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$
- $\gamma \in (0, 1]$ is a scalar discount factor

At each time $t$, the policy $\pi$ takes a look at the current state of the environment $s_t$ and produces an action $a_t = \pi(s_t)$. After taking this action, we can fetch reward $r_t = r(s_t, a_t)$, next state $s_{t+1}$ and the episode termination signal $e_t$ from the environment. The basic transition in each step is $\tau = (s_t, a_t, r_t, e_0, s_{t+1}, a_{t+1})$, which forms the trajectory $\Tau = (s_t, a_t, r_t, e_0, ..., s_H, a_H)$ of `VectorSARTTrajectory` we mentioned above. The trajectory distribution $p_\pi$ for a given MDP $\mathcal{M}$ and policy $\pi$ is given by

$$p_\pi(\Tau) = d_0(s_0)\prod_{t=0}^H \pi(a_t|s_t) \mathcal{T}(s_{t+1}|s_t, a_t)$$

 The only goal in reinforcement learning is to maximize some form of the expected return. And we focus on the discounted rewards below

$$R_t = \sum_{i \ge 0} \gamma^ir_t = r_t + \gamma R_{t+1}$$

### 3.1 State Value Function and State-Action Value function

Note that if we can estimate the state value or state-action value accurately, it will be easy to get a near-optimal policy. The state value function $V^\pi(s_t)$ estimates the return $R_t$ by following the policy $\pi$ starting from state $s_t$:

$$V^\pi(s_t) = \mathbb{E}_{\Tau \sim p_\pi(\Tau | s_t)} R_t$$

Similarly, for state action value function $Q^\pi(s_t, a_t)$, it estimates $R_t$ by following the policy $\pi$ starting from a state-action pair $(s_t, a_t)$:

$$Q^\pi(s_t, a_t) = \mathbb{E}_{\Tau \sim p_\pi(\Tau | s_t, a_t)} R_t$$

We can derive the recursive definitions of these two functions:

$$V^\pi(s_t) = \mathbb{E}_{a_t \sim \pi(a_t|s_t)} [Q^\pi(s_t, a_t)]$$

$$Q^\pi(s_t, a_t) = r(s_t, a_t) + \gamma \mathbb{E}_{s_{t+1} \sim \mathcal{T}(s_{t+1}|s_t, a_t)}[V^\pi(s_{t+1})]$$

And combining the above two equations, we can describe $Q^\pi(s_t, a_t)$  in terms of $Q^\pi(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1})$:

$$Q^\pi(s_t, a_t) = r(s_t, a_t) + \gamma \mathbb{E}_{s_{t+1} \sim \mathcal{T}(s_{t+1}|s_t, a_t), a_{t+1} \sim \pi (a_{t+1} | s_{t+1})}[Q^\pi(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1})]$$

With the policy of Q-function, $\pi(a_t|s_t) = \underset{a_t}{\argmax} \ Q(s_t, a_t)$, we have the following condition on the optimal Q-function:

$$Q^\star (s_t, a_t) = r(s_t, a_t) + \gamma \mathbb{E}_{s_{t+1} \sim \mathcal{T}(s_{t+1}|s_t, a_t)} \left[ \underset{a_{t+1}}{\max}\  Q^\star(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1}) \right]$$

#### 3.1.1 VBasedPolicy

To estimate the state value of some specific policy $V^\pi$, a `VBasedPolicy` is provided in our package:

```julia
struct VBasedPolicy{L,M} <: AbstractPolicy
    learner::L
    mapper::M
end

(p::VBasedPolicy)(env::AbstractEnv) = p.mapper(env, p.learner)
```

Basically it contains two parts, a value `learner` $V$ and a mapper policy $\pi$. And all the updating to this policy will be forwarded to the inner `learner`.

**Monte Carlo Prediction for Estimating $V^\pi$**

Now let's start from a very basic value learner, the Monte Carlo based value learner. The idea is to apply the `VBasedPolicy` until the end of an episode. And update the value estimation of each state with the accumulated averaging $R(s)$. There're two steps involved in implementing such a `learner`:

1. Updating the `trajectory`
2. Updating the `learner`

By default, the `VectorSARTTrajectory` we've seen above will add all the transitions into it. But this is not what we want in the Monte Carlo based value learner here. We only need one episode actually. So we can empty the trajectory at the beginning of each episode by implementing:

```julia
RLBase.update!(
    t::AbstractTrajectory,
    ::VBasedPolicy{MCLearner},
    ::AbstractEnv,
    ::PreEpisodeStage
)
    empty!(t)
end
```

Next, we update the `learner` only at the end of an episode. So we have the following method implemented:

```julia
RLBase.update!(
    ::MCLearner,
    ::AbstractTrajectory,
    ::AbstractEnv,
    ::PostEpisodeStage
)
    # update inner tabular appxorimator
end
```

**Tabular TD(0) for estimating $V^\pi$**

Another approach to estimate the value function is to use the zero step temporal-difference learning. The main difference compared to the MC method above is that, now we update the `learner` and `trajectory` at the `PostActStage` and `PostEpisodeStage`.

#### 3.1.2 QBasedPolicy

In our package, the `QBasedPolicy` is provided for all the general Q function based policies. It consists of a Q value learner and an explorer to select action based on the estimated  Q value.

```julia
struct QBasedPolicy{L, E} <: AbstractPolicy
    learner::L
    explorer::E
end

(p::QBasedPolicy)(env::AbstractEnv) = env |> p.learner |> p.explorer
```

Similar to the `VBasedPolicy`, when wrapped in an `Agent`, all updating to `QBasedPolicy` will be forwarded to the inner value `learner`. 

**TabularQLearning**

For tabular Q-learning, we use a `TabularQApproximator` to estimate the $Q(s_t, a_t)$. At each `PostActStage`, we calculate the TD error:

$$\delta = r_t + \gamma \max_{a_{t+1} \sim \pi(a_{t+1}|s_{t+1})} Q(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1}) - Q(s_t, a_t)$$

And use it to update the inner `TabularApproximator`. From the API implementation level, if the `QBasedPolicy{<:TabularQLearner}` is used together with a `VectorSARTTrajectory` like we mentioned above, then we should remember to empty the trajectory at the end of each episode. 

**BasicDQN**

To tackle problems with a large state space, a neural network $Q_\phi$ is used to estimate the $Q^\pi$ where $\phi$ is the parameters\dcite{mnih2013playing}. To optimize the parameters, we can optimize the loss function of $L_i(\phi_i)$ at each `PreActStage` $i$:

$$L_i(\phi_i) = \mathbb{E}_{s, a \sim \Tau} \left[ (y_i(s, a) - Q_{\phi_i}(s, a))^2 \right]$$

where $y_i$ is a bootstrap target:

$$y_i(s, a) = \mathbb{E}_{s\prime \sim \mathcal{T}(s, a)}[ r + \gamma \max_{a\prime \sim \pi(s\prime)} Q_{\phi_{i-1}}(s\prime, a\prime)]$$

Compared to **TabularQLearning**, we need the following modifications:

1. A `CircularArraySARTTrajectory` is used instead of `VectorSARTTrajectory`
2. The `TabularApproximator` is replaced with `NeuralNetworkApproximator` 

Since DQN and its variants usually need to sample minibatches from a trajectory, inspired by adders and inserters in Acme, we also exported some `AbstractSampler` . Users may refer the source code for some extra enhancements like double-dqn and n-step dqn.

**Prioritized DQN**

The biggest challenge to implement Prioritized DQN is to create a new Trajectory. Fortunately, adding a new trace is pretty simple given that a Trajectory is merely a wrapper of a `NamedTuple`. To make sure each transition is inserted correctly, developers should carefully examine all the default implementations of  `update!(trajectory, policy, env, stage)` and write your more specific ones when needed. For Prioritized DQN, we need to insert a default priority at the `PostActStage`. When updating the inner learner, we also need to update the priority trace.

**IQN**

For distributional reinforcement learning algorithms like C51\dcite{bellemare2017distributional} and IQN\dcite{dabney2018implicit}, the estimation is not the Q-values directly. But we can still fit them into the `QBasedPolicy`. The main change is to override the default implementation of `(p::QBasedPolicy)(env::AbstractEnv)` to use the Q value distribution.

### 3.2 Policy Gradient

This [article](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2018/04/08/policy-gradient-algorithms.html)\dcite{weng2018PG} already gives a detailed explanation to a lot of policy gradient algorithms. Here we only describe some notable points to implement them. Some of the implemented policies (for example PPO) are very interesting and worth explaining them in detail in another blog later.

**MultiThreadEnv**

Except for some Monte Carlo based policy gradient algorithms (like **Vanilla Policy Gradient**), we usually roll out several simulations simultaneously and collect the transitions every $n$ steps to train the policies. So this special environment wrapper is introduced to run several copies of environments by leveraging multi-threading. This environment breaks the workflow we defined before because `is_terminated(::MultiThreadEnv)` doesn't return a bool value any more. Also, the `PreEpisodeStage` and `PostEpisodeStage` are not valid. So a more specific implementation is defined.

```julia
function RLCore._run(
    policy::AbstractPolicy,
    env::MultiThreadEnv,
    stop_condition,
    hook::AbstractHook,
)

    while true
        action = policy(env)
        policy(PRE_ACT_STAGE, env, action)
        hook(PRE_ACT_STAGE, policy, env, action)

        env(action)

        policy(POST_ACT_STAGE, env)
        hook(POST_ACT_STAGE, policy, env)

        if stop_condition(policy, env)
            break
        end
    end
end
```

And the corresponding updating to the trajectory is also provided by default.

### 3.3 Offline Reinforcement Learning

In offline reinforcement learning, we often assume the experience is prepared ahead. To adapt some of the above algorithms in the offline setting, we need to provide a more specific implementation of `update!(policy, batch)` and reuse it in `update!(policy, trajectory, env stage)` . For new offline algorithms, we only need to implement the following two methods:

1. `(p::YourOfflinePolicy)(env::AbstreactEnv)`
2. `update!(p::YourOfflinePolicy, batch)`

### 3.4 Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

In our initial workflow, there's only one agent interacting with the environment. To expand it to the multi-agent setting, a policy wrapper of `MultiAgentPolicy` is added. At each stage, it fetch necessary information and forward the `env` to its children. Then based on the current player of the `env`, it selects the right child and generate an action properly.

#### Counterfactual Regret Minimization

## 4. Experiments

For each policy in our package, we provide at least an `Experiment` to make sure it works in some basic experiments or reproduces the results in the original paper. A thorough report will be provided soon after Julia@v1.6 is released.

## 5. Thoughts

### 5.1 Best Practices

It's hard to imagine that it's been years since we created this package. The following tips are what we learned during this period:

1. Keep interfaces stupid simple and minimal

    Adding new APIs is very cheap, but soon you will be the only one who knows
    how to use them. Keeping APIs stupid simple and minimal will force you
    rethink your existing design and come up with a more natural one. Actually,
    the multi-dispatch in Julia encourages you to generalize the interfaces as
    much as possible.

2. Design early and refactor frequently

    Once started coding, things will evolve very quickly. Focusing on new
    features only will introduce a lot of ad-hoc workarounds on the old design.
    To keep the system flexible, always remember to reserve some time for
    refactoring.

3. ”Premature optimization is the root of all evil!“

    In most cases, the overall simplicity is more important then speed. With
    multiple dispatch, it's always relatively easy to come up with a more
    efficient implementation without loss of generality.

4. Maintain a set of reproducible experiments

    For experiments that can be finished in minutes, we should add them into tests and make sure they produce the same result after each PR. For large experiments, it's a good practice to run them after each patch release.

### 5.2 Looking Forward

We've witnessed the fast development of the reinforcement learning field in the last several years. A lot of interesting algorithms are not included yet so contributions are always welcomed.
